                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi there! I'm Alvaro Ajenjo, a programmer, designer, VFX artist and in general a videogame enthusiast. Since I got my first console when I was 7 years old I have not been able to separate myself from them, and over time I realized that they are my true passion. This led me to study Computer Engineering, and later a master's degree specialized in videogame programming, but I've also been learning a multitude of disciplines that can be applied to their development directly or indirectly: from making my first steps as a pixel artist to playing the guitar, writing narrative or being interested in audiovisual communication. Keep scrolling down to learn more about me!

                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <p>
                    My professional programming experience already exceeds 3 years. In my most recent job as Junior Generalist Programmer at Artax Games I could not only apply all my knowledge acquired during my degree and master in 'Bluey: The Videogame', but I also learned a lot from my colleagues and leads.
                    You can review all my work in more detail in my portfolio, where you will also find several personal projects, both programming and design and other areas of work.

                </p>
                <h1>Hobbies</h1>
                <p>
                    I love video games, and this has led me to create them not only as a job, but as a hobby. For this reason I also sign up to every Game Jam I can, since my profile is very complete to support my team in the best possible way.
                    But not everything was going to be video games, and I also love reading, writing, the audiovisual world through series and movies, etc. I am a big fan of sports, climbing and a very sociable person, so every week I look for some time to meet with friends.

                    If you want to know more about me, don't hesitate to contact me!
